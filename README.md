## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This website challenge was to use floats. Additionally, this is one of the first implementations of javascript to enable changing of the hero image in a slideshow format. Another of the challenges was to transform text into vertical text and keep it inside the container.

## Optimizations

Planning to:
- [ ] Make site responsive
- [ ] Improve accessibility with alt text and WCAG standards
- [ ] Improving web sustainability with WSG and checking website carbon footprint 

## Lessons Learned:

It was challenging to work with floats as well as to transform text. Additionally I had to figure out how to offset text and images to align properly and match a style guide that was somewhat outside of simple grid layouts.
